                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Drawing on over two decades of experience in education, I've cultivated a strong ability to understand others' needs and respond to them with effective, practical solutions. Coupled with a recent, intensive refresh of my coding and computer science knowledge - specifically through the Boot.dev back-end development course in Python and Go - I am now seeking opportunities to merge this insight with my passion for creating effective software. My approach to work and life is empathetic, pragmatic and optimistic: I like to delve into a problem to understand it thoroughly, prototyping rapidly to find innovative, elegant and performant solutions. I am passionate about finding ways for technology to enhance the various facets of our lives, without distraction or incumberance.</p>
